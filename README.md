# String Manipulation Questions for General Practice

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of string manipulation questions that are great for general practice. String manipulation is a fundamental topic in programming, and mastering it will help you solve many problems efficiently. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, competitive programming, or improving your programming skills, these problems are essential for honing your understanding of string handling.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of common string manipulation exercises that help users practice:

- String reversal
- Palindrome detection
- Substring search
- String formatting
- Character counting
- Anagram detection
- String transformations

By solving these problems, you'll be able to develop a deeper understanding of how strings work and improve your coding abilities.

## Problem Examples
Here are some examples of string manipulation problems you will find in this repository:

1. **Reverse a String**  
   Given a string, reverse it and return the new string.

2. **Check Palindrome**  
   Given a string, check if it is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same backward as forward).

3. **Count Character Frequency**  
   Given a string, return the frequency of each character in the string.

4. **Find the First Non-Repeated Character**  
   Given a string, return the first character that does not repeat.

5. **Check for Anagrams**  
   Given two strings, determine if they are anagrams of each other.

6. **Remove Duplicates**  
   Given a string, remove all duplicate characters while maintaining the order of their first occurrence.

7. **Substring Search**  
   Given a string and a target substring, determine if the target exists in the string.
